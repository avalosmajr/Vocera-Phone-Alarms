# Research Project Assessment

**This assessment is for the final research project only.** Use the `assessment.md` file for all mini-projects.


## Instructions

Before submitting your research project draft for grading, confirm:

1. The manuscript .qmd for your project is in the root directory and knits to .pdf without error.
2. The knitted .pdf of your draft is in the root directory, with the same filename as the .qmd.
3. This `research-assessment.md` file is in the root directory of your project repo.
4. Dr. Dowling and your section TA are collaborators on your GitHub repo with permissions to pull/push.

To complete this assessment:

1. Complete the basic information section and AI statement. 
2. Confirm all links are correct and accessible
3. Check off all objectives you are attempting to demonstrate
    1. To earn 30 points you must demonstrate each objective. However, you do not need to attempt all objectives with each draft if your goal is to build the project over time.
    2. If the objective is demonstrated somewhere other than the .qmd, add a note in the grader comments section for where to find it (e.g., "see `data-cleaning.R` lines 20-30").
4. Optionally, complete the reflection section, which may earn engagement points.

## AI Statement

Describe whether and how you used AI/LLMs when completing this project: 

Optionally (for engagement points) reflect on your use of AI:

AI or ChatGPT was used throughout this draft to debug personal code, help understand/create comments, obtain opinions/ideas, and write code. It should be noted that it was unclear what was classified as “text” from ChatGPT before submission; for instance, ChatGPT did aid in creating graphs. 
However, there is uncertainty about whether the axis and plot title(s) are classified as code or text since it was created by ChatGPT when asked for help for code. Going forward, lines that obtain ChatGPT will be marked. 

I believe the usage of ChatGPT is appropriate and helpful but highly stressful. I say this because if I do not know something (e.g., geom_line), I can search for it and have the definition within seconds instead of logging into Canvas, finding the correct slides, and then going through them. 
It is beneficial academically only if you create notes as you go; if you do not, it becomes passive, which I officially learned last night. I initially thought I could remember certain things because, at the moment, it is like, Oh, I know this now. The truth is you still need to take notes actively, but I am discovering how to learn, log, and use this. 
I debated on whether to use any AI because of the plagiarism portion of it. I just started using AI this quarter because I realized it is the future, and I am putting myself at a disadvantage by not using it at times, but there are so many different beliefs on plagiarism and more. I am an anxious person, so using AI is a double-edged sword. 
For instance, I freaked out and still do at times when I use Grammarly; it is a very odd time to me because plagiarism and AI are subjective (at least I think). The AI and plagiarism situation can ruin a person's career, which I am unsure is fair since this is a transition/learning period for countless. 


## Overall requirements

Overall requirements for the research project are as follows:

1. The project must be a research project. It must provide background on a research topic, ask at least one research question, use data to attempt to answer that question, report the results of the data analysis, and interpret the results in the context of the research question.
2. The project must be contained in a github repository that follows git best practices and includes all necessary files to run the project from start to finish, including:
    1. The .qmd file for the manuscript
    2. All data files used in the project
    3. All scripts used in the project
    4. A README.md file & .gitignore file
3. The project must be reproducible -- a reader should be able to clone the repo and run the .qmd from start to finish without error. The .qmd file should include:
    1. A YAML header with all fields necessary for an APA manuscript
    2. Setup source chunks that load libraries, read in data, set chunk options, set seed, etc.
    3. Minimally, an IMRD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion), though it may be more complex
    4. Integration of markdown and code chunks throughout, following best practices for using code chunks
    5. Figures and tables rendered in code chunks
    6. Inline R code & references to render data-dependent text
    7. At least 1 descriptive analysis and 1 hypothesis test, either in code chunks or sourced scripts
    8. Frequent and informative code comments throughout
4. The .qmd file should knit/render to an APA7 formatted manuscript with one click and no errors. The knitted manuscript should include:
    1. A title page with title, author, and institutional affiliation
    2. An abstract (this may be minimal, but should exist)
    3. Narrative text comprising a complete research report
    4. APA7 references, both in-text citations and a References page
    5. Publication-ready figures (2+) and tables (1+)
    6. Results of all analyses presented in-text (and where appropriate, in tables), with no raw R output; where possible, all text should be data-dependent and rendered with inline R code
    7. Quarto generated references to all figures and tables
    8. Statistical analyses and figures interpreted in narrative text
5. The .qmd should render a .pdf identical to the .pdf you submit for grading


## Assessment

The final project must demonstrate each of 30 the course learning objectives, each worth 1 point. 

Below each learning objective is a list of general expectations for meeting that objective. You should aim to meet all expectations to earn a point for meeting the objective, but these are not rigid requirements. For example, writing a complex and creative function that uses multiple arguments and returns a complex output could meet the "parse and define functions and arguments" objective, even if it is only used in one context.

Refer to the website for general tips on meeting these objectives and an FAQ.

        -   [X] Objective attempt
        -   [ ] Objective met
        -   Grader comments: 
            1. Some of these plots are very difficult to interpret. I'm particularly confused by "Nurse Turn Event Trends Over Time". In your final manuscript, be sure that you both 1) include apa-note captions to sufficiently guide your reader to understand what they're looking at and 2) include sufficient narrative text to explain the meaning and utility of the figure.
            2. In some cases (like the plot named above), you may need to consider whether the geom(s) you've chosen are the way you've mapped aesthetics are the best way to organize your plot.

    4. Includes at least 1 footnote
    - NOTE: This is going to be one of the most flexible objectives to demonstrate.  You need to demonstrate a range of markdown skills and use them to make a readable, informative manuscript. Hitting the four points above should do that, but you can use your judgment about what kind of markdown features will best serve your project. No matter what, you should use markdown to follow APA7 guidelines.

## Reflection (Optional)

Optionally (for engagement points) write a brief reflection about your work on this project. You can use this space to answer the following questions, but feel free to ignore these questions and write about whatever you think is most important.

- What was the most challenging aspect of this project?
I think the most challenging aspect is finding ways to incorporate everything. You have to find different approaches to make things work when you are trying to check all of the objectives; for instance, 
turning characters into factors so you can use forecats but then NA shows up as your values forcing you to figure that out part is necessary if you want to check that objective. If it was not mandatory 
I would just have left it as a chr value. 

- What was the most rewarding aspect of this project?
I find it extremely rewarding when you spend hours and it is time for bed. I know this is not a deep inspirational academic answer, but it is honest. 

- What would you do differently if you were to start over?
I would be more patient with myself and the process. I added comments later which kind of hurt me. I say that because I would hit errors in my run then refer to previous chunks or lines 
that had no comments. In the moment its like oh this is this and that is that and you enter the state of flow and continue without making notes and I feel that may be a bio studying side effect
because it is like this leads to this to this to this and allows for this but here that is not how it works here one tiny thing in the process can change the course of everything AND not everything is 
that is written is correct which I read over it with that thought.

- What did you learn from this project that you will carry forward to future projects?
MAKE NOTES AS YOU GO. DO NOT CARE HOW SILLY THE NOTE IS IF YOU FORGET WHAT ANYTHING IS JUST WRITE IT.

- What are you most proud of in this project?
Trying my best based on the circumstances. 

Alternatively/additionally in mind some of the suggested ways to earn engagement points, and expand on this (or other aspects of your project) in your reflection:

- Creating many figures and tables, or particularly complex or creative ones
- Impressively thoughtful and thorough narrative writing in your literature review or discussion section
- Employing sophisticated statistical techniques in your analysis
- Making excellent use of markdown features to create a polished final product
- Having a maximally reproducible and dynamic manuscript
- Fully committing to best practices for version control and GitHub integration/organization




## Grading

All final projects are graded by Dr. Dowling. You will see your grade on Canvas separated into two categories: objective points and engagement points.

-   **Objective points:** 9/30
-   **Engagement points:** 4/10
-   **Total points:** 13/40

**Comments:** Nice work, Michael -- you're making good progress! The next thing you focus on should be organizing your repository. In particular, the manuscript .qmd should be the only qmd in your whole repo, and the repo should not contain any files not related to the project or necessary to run the project. Currently you have your work split between two qmds, including having plots render in a different qmd than the manuscript, which kind of defeats the purpose. Also, the main qmd does not knit as is; there is too much wrong with the YAML header. I suggest deleting the current YAML header and starting over with a "minimal example" from the apaquarto documentation. Remember that YAML is whitespace sensitive, so be careful about where you put spaces, line breaks, and indentation. Also remember that any empty files may cause your render to quit unexpectedly.

Nice job with the tidyverse functions and ggplot2 plots -- you're doing a good job of incorporating these into your project. Keep up the good work!
