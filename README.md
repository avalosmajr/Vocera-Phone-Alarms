# Final-Research-Project-Reattempt
Final Project w/ quarto and apaquarto re-attempt  

#ProjectUpdate
- Now that I have successfully created this repo for my final research project, I will rename 'final-research-project-reattempt' to something clear and precise. I will then change the name of 'final-project' to 'practice'.
- I am currently writing a QI determination and will be waiting for approval. 
- The method of data transfer will include the following: 
  1) Record all data in Redcap to ensure the safety of sensitive data
  2) Following this, I will de-identify the sensitive and save it to the Box as an Excel (box and Excel will serve as my intermediate). For safety reasons, I will use the         box as the intermediate.
  3) I will then upload the de-identified data to R to be analyzed. 
- The QI was sent in on 1/24/25. Now waiting for the decision.
- It was determined that I will have to create a fake data set.
- This project aims to serve as the final location for the final research assessment.
